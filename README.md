# 🧩 Sudoku Solver  

A Python-based **Sudoku Solver** that uses the **Backtracking Algorithm** to efficiently solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles.

## 🚀 Features  
- Solves any valid **9x9 Sudoku** puzzle  
- Uses the **Backtracking Algorithm** for an optimized solution  
- Simple **Python script** with clear output  
- Can be extended to work with a graphical interface  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Backtracking Algorithm** – For solving the puzzle efficiently  

(Make sure you have Python installed)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The algorithm finds an empty cell in the Sudoku grid.
2. It tries placing numbers 1-9 while checking if they are valid.
3. If a number is valid, it proceeds to the next empty cell.
4. If no number is valid, it backtracks to the previous step and tries a different number.
5. The process repeats until the puzzle is solved.
